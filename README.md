 have created my login screen and employee tables in the database. Using NetBeans, I generated my database class and established the database connection. For the login screen design, I created a JFrame form and added a "Login" button with an assigned event. I wrote SQL queries, executed them, and assigned the returned results to a ResultSet. I designed the employee table using JDialog.
After implementing the functionality to add employees, I also developed a method to view them. I added buttons for adding, updating, and deleting employees, and assigned corresponding events to these buttons. Later on, I completed the project by writing necessary queries and methods to ensure comprehensive functionality.
